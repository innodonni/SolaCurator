Hint to move bins after trying and failing before
Make cushions a class with instances
Messages for pushing/pulling ajar door could improve (ideally they could be blocked by cushions!)
Ben needs to ask the player questions too
Fix TeleportScope to choose most precise object ('church building' shouldn't take you to Church)
Better scenery of Ben's house and open land

awake with Ben/old man
sunlight streams in - red like burnt umber
day 2 - add new dialogue options (replace quip function?)
FOLLOW option reiterated - say you've thought about it, and you'll be able to make an extra stop somewhere...
if not FOLLOW - teleport to day 4

idle chitchat - contextual 
He's more talkative than you - forced conversation...mumble suit yourself if no reply
- shall I bring my bike?...don't want to leave unchained?

'fetch' bike (another complicated verb - worth it?) - will have to be portable for day 3 anyway

PACKING SCENE limit movement out of Churchyard, garden, house - use Moderator library to manage day differences?
remove can so that bike cannot be placed in can. move card to rucksack (don't need to get it out again)

NEW item - bucket - dubious history so not suitable container put bellcord in bucket
?cushion on bucket - don't want to squish it inside? force to put on top
- what's this bucket for?
-- seat, basin, saucepan and chamber pot!
-- what are you used to eating?
- dried meat and seeds
-- will I need a helmet?
- I hope you're not serious.
-- got a towel?
-- how much water do you have?
- Ben takes your canteen and goes indoors to fill it
-- what do you think - could that radio be fixed?

Big questions:
How will the bike be recharged? 'Leave that to me'? Ask Ben to fix solar panels?
How will your doubts be teased out during conversation if player is in control?
What new reason is there to not stray too far? Impassable water (sea!)? Attend to traps?
You need to find water and wood (easier said than done - wet?). How to maximise existing verbs?

- how old are you?
-- how about you?
- let's see I was born ...
-- uhuh
- and the current year is ...
-- so you're .

-- you're in good health.
- I guess I am.
- What do you mean by that?
- What about your son? + You said it's been hard on him.
