>visit bike
(finding the motorbike in the Town)

Town
Once a farming settlement, the buildings here are the ruined shells of simple
dwellings. Most of the roofs caved in centuries ago, but if you can find one
intact it's still your best bet for staying warm overnight. The street continues
south towards a square and the main road stretches out of town to the north-
east.

Your bike stands chained here.

>x bike
It's a standard electric motorbike, and your ticket to finding the City of
Peace.
The motorbike is currently switched off.
On the motorbike are a battery and a chain.

>x buildings
None of the dwellings here appear to be inhabitable.

>search street
You find nothing of interest.

>search buildings
You find nothing of interest.

>ne
You wearily survey the road you arrived on as it tails into the distance. An old
billboard stands at the side of the road leading into town.

>x board
Whatever was on the billboard peeled off long ago and it is now host to a
veritable bulletin board of writing from visitors.

>search board
You smile wryly; searching in the digital sense wouldn't be possible because the
Internet is a thing of the past. You don't notice any familiar names without
reading it in full.

>read board
Much of what has been written is in an old language you recognise as English,
but there is some modern Arabic as well. From what you can read, you aren't the
first person travelling this route to Jerusalem for answers.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>go south

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than
a few dozen paces across surrounded by buildings, but is littered with detritus
from campers. The street continues north out of town.

>x square
That's not something you need to refer to in the course of this game.

>x buildings
Which do you mean, the dwellings or the church building?

>search buildings
Which do you mean, the dwellings or the church building?

>search square
The taller building on the east side appears to be a church. Hopefully the roof
is intact.

>search dwellings
The taller building on the east side appears to be a church. Hopefully the roof
is intact.

>x church
(the church doors)
The wooden doors have withstood the elements and are still solid and impassable.
Their only feature is a round brass handle on each.

>x graffiti
I suppose you could call it art. Although it has been drawn over several times,
it looks like both the "Goats" and the "K-Rhyme" gangs have tagged this town.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>search graffiti
Some stars of David and Star and Crescents have been drawn in solidarity with
other visitors.

>x doors
The wooden doors have withstood the elements and are still solid and impassable.
Their only feature is a round brass handle on each.

>pull knob
The brass handles are fixed in place.

>twist knob
The handles won't turn - they seem to be just to grip the door with.

>touch knob
You feel nothing unexpected.

>touch door
You feel nothing unexpected.

>push door
The church doors seem to be locked.

>listen at doors
Silence - perfect place to sleep!

>look between doors
There is a gap between the doors. It looks like only a latch keeps the doors
shut.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>x latch
You see nothing special about the latch.

>x clothes
As good-looking as ever.

>search clothes
There are pockets in your shirt and trousers.

>x pockets
Which do you mean, the shirt pocket or the trouser pockets?

>x trouser pockets
Deep pockets, ready for adventure! Still, you try not to use them in case
anything falls out.

>search trouser pockets
To your surprise, you find your bank card in your trouser pockets. Thankfully it
didn't fall out while you were riding along - it could come in handy.

>x card  
You wonder why you carry this around. Banks are a relic of the past.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>remove card from bag
You can't see any such thing.

>drop card
You might want to hold onto that, even though you have no money in the bank at
the moment.

>open church door with card
(first taking the bank card)
By slotting your bank card between the doors, you manage to lift the latch. You
unlock the church doors.
You put your bank card away in your pocket until you need to use it.

>push door
You open the church doors.

>close church door
The doors latch shut, locking intruders out.

>lift latch with card
(first taking the bank card)
You lift the latch and the door opens.

>pull church door
(first taking the handle)
The doors latch shut, locking intruders out.

>lift latch
You cannot fit your hand between the doors.

>raise latch with card
(first taking the bank card)
You lift the latch and the door opens.

>enter church
(the church doors)

Church
The church is furnished with altar and pews and is quite a contrast from the
mess outside. Sunlight streams in through high windows, but the room is
welcomingly cool.

The door to the church stands ajar.

[The score has just gone up by twenty points.]

>x windows
Tall, arched windows let in sunlight high out of reach.

>get window
You can't reach the windows.

>push doors
The doors latch shut, locking intruders out.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>lift latch
You lift the latch easily and the door opens.

>pull knob
Do you intend to exit?

>sit down
(on the altar)
As you put your weight on the altar, it wobbles. If the legs aren't all the same
length, you might as well sleep on the floor.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>sleep
Ideally you would have somewhere soft to sleep.

>make fire
Ideally you would have somewhere soft to sleep.

>make bed
Ideally you would have somewhere soft to sleep.

>x altar
(the altar)
What you assume to be the altar is a bare, unembellished stone table. Any cloth,
cross or other religious artefacts seem to have been removed for safekeeping.

>pray at altar
(the altar)
Silence - perfect time to sleep!

>jump over altar
(the altar)
You achieve nothing by this.

>jump on altar
(the altar)
As you put your weight on the altar, it wobbles. If the legs aren't all the same
length, you might as well sleep on the floor.
Jumping upon the altar would achieve nothing here.

>climb on altar
(the altar)
As you put your weight on the altar, it wobbles. If the legs aren't all the same
length, you might as well sleep on the floor.

>sleep on altar
(the altar)
Nowhere near ideal.

>look under altar
(the altar)
Stubby stone legs protrude from the bottom of the altar. They are high enough
off the ground to allow the altar to wobble, but not high enough for anything to
go underneath.

>x altar legs
Stubby stone legs protrude from the bottom of the altar. They are high enough
off the ground to allow the altar to wobble, but not high enough for anything to
go underneath.

>jump over pews
You achieve nothing by this.

>jump

Some mortar dust descends from the ceiling.
You jump on the spot, fruitlessly.

>listen
You hear nothing unexpected.

>sleep on pew

The pews are alright to sit on, but not ideal to sleep on.

>sit in pew
You heave a sigh of relief to have a place to sit at a proper height. Still, you
decide the pews aren't wide enough to sleep on. As you unconsciously lean
forward to stretch your back, you notice something underneath. 
[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>touch door
You feel nothing unexpected.

>look under pews
Under each pew are small cushions.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>take cushion
There are too many cushions to do that.

>put cushion on pew
(first taking the cushions)
Dropped.

>throw cushion at windows
(first taking the cushions)
There are too many cushions to do that.

>drop bag
Time to make up your bed!

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>open bag
You open the rucksack.

>take file
Taken.

>x file
In addition to your journal is a pile of various notes you have collected.

>read file
The journal is bound shut with bulging elastic straps.

>unstrap file
That's not a verb I recognise.

>open file
You carefully undo the straps that wrap up your notes and bind your journal
closed.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>read file
The first page of your journal begins:
Research topics / article ideas (year):
Calendar dates - does history matter any more? (863)
Inking - ancient printing revised for the modern era (868)
Goat psychology - eyewitnesses and "left behind" syndrome (877)
Sola Scriptura - what the Bible might have said (952)
Final solutions - flooding the world with clean water (986)
Abysmal release - devillish designs for humanity (993)
God incarnate - what is love?

No number has been written for the last entry.

>search file
There's too many pages to rifle through, but you could look something up.

>look up foo in file
Blab

>get up
(of the altar)
You aren't on the altar.

>take bag
Taken.

>put file away
I didn't understand that sentence.

>drop file
You place the papers gently back in your bag. You don't want to lose any pages
accidentally.

>sleep on ground
There is still enough daylight to find a more suitable spot to settle.

>make bed
This is the end of the demo. Please form an orderly queue to hand in your
feedback.
Thank you for playing!

>visit pew and empty bag on pew
The game does not keep track of your path through the rooms, nor your

directions.  If you wish to visit a new location or return to a previous one,
you will have to type the directions to take you there -- NORTH, UP, etc.

>give me a hint
[These suggestions are lengthy, so the game will periodically pause while
printing them.  To stop the instructions mid-flow, press Q at a pause; to
continue, press any other key.]

Explore.  Examine every object mentioned in room descriptions, and everything in
your inventory.  Examine yourself, too. Look inside all closed containers.  Open
all doors and go through them.  If anything is locked, that's probably a puzzle,
and you should try to get it unlocked.

Try out all your senses.  If the game mentions an interesting texture, odor, or
sound, try SMELLing, TOUCHing, LISTENing, etc.

Be thorough.  If you *still* can't figure out what to do, try opening windows,
looking under beds, etc.  Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

Reread.  Look back at things you've already seen; sometimes this will trigger an
idea you hadn't thought of.

Take hints from the prose of the game.  Things that are described in great
detail are probably more important than things that are given one-liners. Play
with those objects.  If a machine is described as having component parts, look
at the parts, and try manipulating them.   Likewise, notice the verbs that the
game itself uses.  Try using those yourself.  Games often include special verbs
-- the names of magic spells, or other special commands.  There's no harm in
attempting something if the game mentions it.

Rephrase.  If you have something in mind that you want to do, but can't get the
game to respond, try alternative wordings.  Often synonyms are provided.  Game
designers usually try to anticipate all the synonyms you are likely to come up
with, but they may not have thought of yours.

Try variations.  Sometimes an action doesn't work, but *does* produce some kind
of unusual result.  These are often indications that you're on the right track,
even if you haven't figured out quite the right approach yet.  Pressing the red
button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps
pressing the blue and *then* the red will open the secret door.

Try to understand the game's internal logic.  Sometimes there is a system in
play that does not operate in the normal world -- a kind of magic, for instance,
or technology we don't have on modern-day earth.  If you've been introduced to
such a system in the game, ask yourself how you might apply it to the situations
that are still causing you problems.

Check the *whole* screen.  Are there extra windows besides the main window? 
What's going on in those?  Check out the status bar, if there is one -- it may
contain the name of the room you're in, your score, the time of day, your
character's state of health, or some other important information.  If there's
something up there, it's worth paying attention to that, too.  When and where
does it change?  Why is it significant?  If the bar is describing your
character's health, you can bet there is probably a point at which that will be
important.

Consider the genre of the game.  Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have
their own types of action and motivation.  What are you trying to do, and how do
conventional characters go about doing that?  What's the right sort of behavior
for a detective/romance heroine/spy?

Play with someone else.  Two heads are usually better than one.

Try typing HINT, HELP, INFO, ABOUT: one or more of these are often implemented
as a source of suggestions about how to get past difficult spots.  If that
doesn't work, try emailing the author or (better yet) posting a request for
hints on the newsgroup rec.games.int-fiction.  For best results, put the name of
the game you want help with in the subject line; then leave a page or so of
blank "spoiler space" (so that no one will read about where you got to in the
game unless they've already played it), and describe your problem as clearly as
possible.  Someone will probably be able to tell you how to get around it.

Email the author: If you're stuck somewhere that just makes no sense at all,
it's possible that you're facing a bug.  If you think you are, you should email
the author (politely) to report the problem and ask for a way around it.
Good luck!

Town
Once a farming settlement, the buildings here are the ruined shells of simple

east.

On the motorbike are a battery and a chain.
