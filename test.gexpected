>leave town
You wearily survey the road you arrived on as it tails into the distance. An old billboard stands at the side of the road leading into town.

>put hands in pockets
left hand: Done.
right hand: Done.
To your surprise, you find your bank card in your trouser pockets. Thankfully it didn't fall out while you were riding along - it could come in handy.

>unlock buildings with right hand

>search self
Your mind is too clouded for introspection right now.

>change mind
You don't need to interact with that stuff.

>give bag to self
You juggle the rucksack for a while, but don't achieve much.

>say prayer to motorcycle gods
You pray fervently for the strength to continue your journey, but the motorbike remains unmoved.

>read self
(first removing shirt)
Across the back of your shirt is emblazoned the phrase "Gamerr". You quickly put it back on!

>get on bike. look
You get onto the motorbike.

Town (on the motorbike)
Once a farming settlement, the buildings here are the ruined shells of simple dwellings. Most of the roofs caved in centuries ago, but if you can find one intact it's still your best bet for staying warm overnight. The street continues south towards a square and the main road stretches out of town to the north-east.

Your bike is comfortable but you miss sitting down without a hot battery between your legs.

>x bike
It's a standard electric motorbike, and your ticket to finding the City of Peace.
The motorbike is currently switched off.
On the motorbike are a battery and a chain.

>x battery
There should be enough charge to finish your journey tomorrow, unless you change your mind before then.

>x chain
The chain is not the most sturdy brand, and the bike is not even chained up to anything. Thankfully there's no-one about.

>untie chain
You don't have the energy or inclination to carry on your journey without a good night's sleep.

>wake up
You're already awake.

>wake bike up
You can only do that to something animate.

>x buildings
None of the dwellings here appear to be inhabitable.

>search street
(first getting off the motorbike)
You find nothing of interest.

>search buildings
The various buildings are empty.

>move rubble
There's no use. You'd rather sleep in the open than shift rubble about, so you press on, hoping for a clean space to camp.

>search rubble
The hopes of scavenging anything are slim, and the allure can wait until morning when you're more fresh.

>take some stones
The shifted rubble sends up a plume of dust and you toss it back, eyes watering. It wouldn't make for very good bedding material.

>pray on roof
The rubble has insufficient authority to grant your request.

>pray to god on roofs
You hear nothing unexpected.

>ne
You wearily survey the road you arrived on as it tails into the distance. An old billboard stands at the side of the road leading into town.

>pray to advertisement
The billboard is unmoved.

>x board
Whatever was on the billboard peeled off long ago and it is now host to a veritable bulletin board of writing from visitors.

>search board
You smile wryly; searching in the digital sense wouldn't be possible because the Internet is a thing of the past. You don't notice any familiar names without reading it in full.

>read board
Much of what has been written is in an old language you recognise as English, but there is some modern Arabic as well. From what you can read, you aren't the first person travelling this route to Jerusalem for answers.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>look under board
Just drifts of dust from the road and discarded dried up marker pens.

>x drifts
Uninteresting dust, not even deep enough to dig.

>dig drifts
You don't need to interact with that stuff.

>x markers
The pens are all dried up and impossible to write with.

>take markers
You don't need to interact with that stuff.

>look under road
You'd have to dig a hole first.

>dig road
You'd need more than a shovel to dig road tar.

>x tar
The road is now no more than a dusty trail, though in the bike tracks you can see that the surface was tarred to a good standard when it was built.

>take the path to the south
I only understood you as far as wanting to take the road.

>go south

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than a few dozen paces across surrounded by tightly-packed buildings, but is littered with detritus from campers. The street continues north out of town.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>x square
You're already at the Square.

>x church
(the church building)
The church building seems to be the only one not covered in graffiti.

The church doors seem to be latched shut.

>x graffiti
I suppose you could call it art. Although it has been drawn over several times, it looks like both the "Goats" and the "K-Rhyme" gangs have tagged this town.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>search graffiti
Some stars of David and Star and Crescents have been drawn in solidarity with other visitors.

>e
You can't since the church doors are in the way.

>search church
(the church building)
The east face of the church has a set of double doors. The windows are set into the walls higher up. To the south-east of the church building is a narrow passage blocked by dustbins.

>x doors
The wooden doors have worn edges but have withstood the elements and are still solid and impassable. Their only feature is a round brass handle on each.

>push handle to door
(the church doors to the church doors)
The church doors are fixed in place.

>listen at gap
You can't see any such thing.

It's all junk - not worth taking.

>pick door
You don't have a set of lockpicks.

>listen at doors
Silence - perfect place to sleep!

>say prayers
You hear nothing unexpected.

Deep pockets, ready for adventure! Still, you try not to use them in case anything falls out.

>x shirt pocket
A decorative pocket, sewn shut. Good thing too - you don't trust pockets.

>x trouser pockets
Deep pockets, ready for adventure! Still, you try not to use them in case anything falls out.

Church
The church is furnished with altar and pews and is quite a contrast from the mess outside. Sunlight streams in through high windows, but the room is welcomingly cool.

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than a few dozen paces across surrounded by tightly-packed buildings, but is littered with detritus from campers. The street continues north out of town.

The bin passage to the south-west is open.

You can also see an upturned paint tin (on which is an old man) here.

"You there!?"
An old man is here, sitting on an upturned paint tin. From his tan, he looks local, but it's hard to tell how old he is - he could be 500.
He doesn't turn to face you as you arrive.

Which do you mean, the left hand or the right hand?

>show hands to self
left hand: Generally speaking, there is no need to refer to your body parts individually in interactive fiction. WEAR SHOES ON FEET will not necessarily be implemented, for instance; WEAR SHOES is enough. And unless you get some hint to the contrary, you probably cannot OPEN DOOR WITH FOOT or PUT THE SAPPHIRE RING IN MY MOUTH.

>tell self to pull oneself together
You can't see any such thing.

You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

BASIC COMMUNICATION
In order to communicate with the game, you will need to enter instructions beginning with imperative verbs -- as though you were giving orders to someone else to carry out. For instance, >CLOSE THE DOOR or >LOOK UNDER THE RUG.

You may use articles ("the" and "a"), but you do not need to. >CLOSE DOOR will also work for the game's purposes.

ROOMS AND TRAVEL
At any given time, you are in a specific location, or room. When you go into a room, the game will print a description of what you can see there. This description will contain two vital kinds of information: things in the room you can interact with or take, and a list of exits, or ways out. If you want to see the description again, you may just type LOOK.

When you want to leave a location and go to another one, you may communicate this to the game using compass directions: eg, GO NORTH. For simplicity's sake, you are allowed to omit the word GO, and to abbreviate the compass directions. So you have NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, NORTHEAST, SOUTHEAST, NORTHWEST, SOUTHWEST, UP, and DOWN, or in short form N, S, E, W, NE, SE, NW, SW, U, and D.

In some locations, IN and OUT will also be useful.

OBJECTS
Throughout the game there will be assorted objects that you can do things with. Most importantly, you may TAKE or GET items, and (when you are tired of them) DROP them again. INVENTORY (abbreviated I) will list the items you are currently holding.

There are usually assorted things you may do with these objects. OPEN, CLOSE, WEAR, EAT, LOCK, and UNLOCK are especially common.

Occasionally, you will find that the game does not recognize the name of an object even though it has been described as being in the room with you. If this is the case, the object is just there for scenery, and you may assume that you do not need to interact with it.

OTHER CHARACTERS
From time to time you will meet other people and creatures. You may use the command >TALK TO CHARACTER, and the game will give you a menu of options, which you may use to converse with the character in plain English.

You may also find it useful to:
Show them an object.
>SHOW WARRANT TO DRUG LORD
>SHOW BUCKET OF WATER TO EVIL WITCH

Ask them about an object.
>ASK PAUL ABOUT HIS BROTHER
>ASK GLENDA ABOUT RUBY SLIPPERS

Tell them about an object.
>TELL ICE CREAM VENDOR ABOUT HIS TRUCK
>TELL DOROTHY ABOUT FLYING MONKEYS

Command them.
>ASK FREDDY TO GIVE ME THE KEY
>TINY TIM, PUT THE UKELELE ON THE TABLE

If you're just not getting through, rely on the menus.

METACOMMANDS
There are a few simple commands for controlling the function of the game itself. These are:

SAVE -- Saves a snapshot of the game as it is now.
RESTORE -- Puts the game back to a previously saved state. (Note: you may keep as many saved games as you like.)
RESTART -- Puts the game back to its initial state.
QUIT -- Ends the game.

>give me a hint
[These suggestions are lengthy, so the game will periodically pause while printing them. To stop the instructions mid-flow, press Q at a pause; to continue, press any other key.]

Explore. Examine every object mentioned in room descriptions, and everything in your inventory. Examine yourself, too. Look inside all closed containers. Open all doors and go through them. If anything is locked, that's probably a puzzle, and you should try to get it unlocked.

Try out all your senses. If the game mentions an interesting texture, odor, or sound, try SMELLing, TOUCHing, LISTENing, etc.

Be thorough. If you *still* can't figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc. Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

Reread. Look back at things you've already seen; sometimes this will trigger an idea you hadn't thought of.

Take hints from the prose of the game. Things that are described in great detail are probably more important than things that are given one-liners. Play with those objects. If a machine is described as having component parts, look at the parts, and try manipulating them.  Likewise, notice the verbs that the game itself uses. Try using those yourself. Games often include special verbs -- the names of magic spells, or other special commands. There's no harm in attempting something if the game mentions it.

Rephrase. If you have something in mind that you want to do, but can't get the game to respond, try alternative wordings. Often synonyms are provided. Game designers usually try to anticipate all the synonyms you are likely to come up with, but they may not have thought of yours.

Try variations. Sometimes an action doesn't work, but *does* produce some kind of unusual result. These are often indications that you're on the right track, even if you haven't figured out quite the right approach yet. Pressing the red button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps pressing the blue and *then* the red will open the secret door.

Try to understand the game's internal logic. Sometimes there is a system in play that does not operate in the normal world -- a kind of magic, for instance, or technology we don't have on modern-day earth. If you've been introduced to such a system in the game, ask yourself how you might apply it to the situations that are still causing you problems.

Check the *whole* screen. Are there extra windows besides the main window? What's going on in those? Check out the status bar, if there is one -- it may contain the name of the room you're in, your score, the time of day, your character's state of health, or some other important information. If there's something up there, it's worth paying attention to that, too. When and where does it change? Why is it significant? If the bar is describing your character's health, you can bet there is probably a point at which that will be important.

Consider the genre of the game. Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have their own types of action and motivation. What are you trying to do, and how do conventional characters go about doing that? What's the right sort of behavior for a detective/romance heroine/spy?

Play with someone else. Two heads are usually better than one.

Try typing HINT, HELP, INFO, ABOUT: one or more of these are often implemented as a source of suggestions about how to get past difficult spots. If that doesn't work, try emailing the author or (better yet) posting a request for hints on the newsgroup rec.games.int-fiction. For best results, put the name of the game you want help with in the subject line; then leave a page or so of blank "spoiler space" (so that no one will read about where you got to in the game unless they've already played it), and describe your problem as clearly as possible. Someone will probably be able to tell you how to get around it.

Email the author: If you're stuck somewhere that just makes no sense at all, it's possible that you're facing a bug. If you think you are, you should email the author (politely) to report the problem and ask for a way around it.
Good luck!

"Do or do not. There is no try."

The parser does not understand polite formulations such as PLEASE LOOK AROUND NOW or KINDLY OPEN THE BOX. Start your commands with an imperative verb and they will work better.

(finding the pews in the Church)

Church
The church is furnished with altar and pews and is quite a contrast from the mess outside. Sunlight streams in through high windows, but the room is welcomingly cool.

The door to the church stands ajar.

On the aisle are some cushions.

You can also see an altar here.
Silence - perfect place to sleep!

>go to town. look at building to south
(visiting the Town)

Town
Once a farming settlement, the buildings here are the ruined shells of simple dwellings. Most of the roofs caved in centuries ago, but if you can find one intact it's still your best bet for staying warm overnight. The street continues south towards a square and the main road stretches out of town to the north-east.

Your bike stands chained here.

On the motorbike are a battery and a chain.
It looks like there are more buildings down in the square.

>square. look at building to south-east

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than a few dozen paces across surrounded by tightly-packed buildings, but is littered with detritus from campers. The street continues north out of town.
The bin passage to the south-east is open.

You can't see any such thing.
