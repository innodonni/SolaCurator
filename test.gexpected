You can go south (to the Square) or northeast.

What next? (beginners, type help<ENTER>)
>search self
Your mind is too clouded for introspection right now.

>change mind
You don't need to do that.

>give bag to self
You juggle the rucksack for a while, but don't achieve much.

>say prayer to motorcycle gods
You pray fervently for the strength to continue your journey, but the motorbike remains unmoved.

>read self
(first removing shirt)
Across the back of your shirt is emblazoned the phrase "Gamerr". You quickly put it back on!

>visit bike
You get onto the motorbike.

>x bike
It's a standard electric motorbike, and your ticket to finding the City of Peace.
The motorbike is currently switched off.
On the motorbike are a battery and a chain.

>x buildings
None of the dwellings here appear to be inhabitable.

>search street
(first getting off the motorbike)
You find nothing of interest.

>search buildings
You find nothing of interest.

>ne
You wearily survey the road you arrived on as it tails into the distance. An old billboard stands at the side of the road leading into town.

>x board
Whatever was on the billboard peeled off long ago and it is now host to a veritable bulletin board of writing from visitors.

>search board
You smile wryly; searching in the digital sense wouldn't be possible because the Internet is a thing of the past. You don't notice any familiar names without reading it in full.

>read board
Much of what has been written is in an old language you recognise as English, but there is some modern Arabic as well. From what you can read, you aren't the first person travelling this route to Jerusalem for answers.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>go south

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than a few dozen paces across surrounded by buildings, but is littered with detritus from campers. The street continues north out of town.

The taller building on the east side appears to be a church. Hopefully the roof is intact.

>x church
The wooden doors have withstood the elements and are still solid and impassable. Their only feature is a round brass handle on each.

>x graffiti
I suppose you could call it art. Although it has been drawn over several times, it looks like both the "Goats" and the "K-Rhyme" gangs have tagged this town.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>search graffiti
Some stars of David and Star and Crescents have been drawn in solidarity with other visitors.

>x doors

>listen at gap
You can't see any such thing.

>pull knob
The brass handles are fixed in place.

>twist knob
The handles won't turn - they seem to be just to grip the door with.

>touch knob
You feel nothing unexpected.

>touch door
The door has been looked after, perhaps was even stained this year. The edges of the doors between the handles have been worn away.

>push door
The church doors seem to be locked.

In the gap between the doors, you can make out the shape of a latch on the other side.

>say prayers
You hear nothing unexpected.

>pray that game ends
You hear nothing unexpected.

God knows what you're after. Maybe you're just standing in the wrong place.

>pray to God that doors open
God knows what you're after. Maybe you're just standing in the wrong place.

>pray to God for doors to open
God knows what you're after. Maybe you're just standing in the wrong place.

>x clothes
There are pockets in your shirt and trousers.

>search clothes
You don't need to do that.

>x pockets
Deep pockets, ready for adventure! Still, you try not to use them in case anything falls out.

>x shirt pocket
A decorative pocket, sewn shut. Good thing too - you don't trust pockets.

>x trouser pockets
Deep pockets, ready for adventure! Still, you try not to use them in case anything falls out.

>search trouser pockets
To your surprise, you find your bank card in your trouser pockets. Thankfully it didn't fall out while you were riding along - it could come in handy.

>x card  
You wonder why you carry this around. Banks are a relic of the past.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

>remove card from bag
You can't see any such thing.

>drop card
You might want to hold onto that, even though you have no money in the bank at the moment.

Church
The church is furnished with altar and pews and is quite a contrast from the mess outside. Sunlight streams in through high windows, but the room is welcomingly cool.

The door to the church stands ajar.

[The score has just gone up by twenty points.]

>sit down
You heave a sigh of relief to have a place to sit at a proper height. Still, you decide the pews aren't wide enough to sleep on. As you unconsciously lean forward to stretch your back, you notice something underneath. You get onto the pews.

[The score has just gone up by five points.]

Ideally you would have somewhere soft to sleep.

>make bed
Ideally you would have somewhere soft to sleep.

>x altar
What you assume to be the altar is a bare, unembellished stone table. Any cloth, cross or other religious artefacts seem to have been removed for safekeeping.

>pray at altar
Silence - perfect time to sleep!

>jump over altar
The altar is too high to jump onto. Perhaps climbing would be less ambitious.

>sleep on altar
As you put your weight on the altar, it wobbles. If the legs aren't all the same length, you might as well sleep on the floor.

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than a few dozen paces across surrounded by buildings, but is littered with detritus from campers. The street continues north out of town.

The door to the church stands ajar.

The bins smell like composted organic material.

Churchyard
The bare yard behind the church is strewn with tufts of weeds.

You can see a garden gate, some bins (in which is rubbish) and an upturned can (on which is an old man) here.
"You there!?"
An old man is here, sitting on an upturned paint tin. From his tan, he looks local, but it's hard to tell how old he is - he could be 500.
He doesn't turn to face you as you arrive.

Town
Once a farming settlement, the buildings here are the ruined shells of simple dwellings. Most of the roofs caved in centuries ago, but if you can find one intact it's still your best bet for staying warm overnight.

Generally speaking, there is no need to refer to your body parts individually in interactive fiction.  WEAR SHOES ON FEET will not necessarily be implemented, for instance; WEAR SHOES is enough.

Generally speaking, there is no need to refer to your body parts individually in interactive fiction.  WEAR SHOES ON FEET will not necessarily be implemented, for instance; WEAR SHOES is enough.  And unless you get some hint to the contrary, you probably cannot OPEN DOOR WITH FOOT or PUT THE SAPPHIRE RING IN MY MOUTH.

>tell self to pull oneself together
You don't feel immensely encouraged.

>throw bag at self
You lack the nerve when it comes to the crucial moment.

>help me find de way
If you would like a list of verbs you could try, type VERBS.

If the problem is more that you don't know how to get going with the game, type INTRO.

If you'd like a sample of a game being played, type DEMO.

Finally, if you know what you want to achieve but can't figure out how to achieve it, type HINT. 

If you are having further difficulty with IF, try looking at some of the online help sites such as http://www.brasslantern.org or http://intfiction.org.

>give me a hint
[These suggestions are lengthy, so the game will periodically pause while printing them.  To stop the instructions mid-flow, press Q at a pause; to continue, press any other key.]

Explore.  Examine every object mentioned in room descriptions, and everything in your inventory.  Examine yourself, too. Look inside all closed containers.  Open all doors and go through them.  If anything is locked, that's probably a puzzle, and you should try to get it unlocked.

Try out all your senses.  If the game mentions an interesting texture, odor, or sound, try SMELLing, TOUCHing, LISTENing, etc.

Be thorough.  If you *still* can't figure out what to do, try opening windows, looking under beds, etc.  Sometimes objects are well-hidden.

Reread.  Look back at things you've already seen; sometimes this will trigger an idea you hadn't thought of.

Take hints from the prose of the game.  Things that are described in great detail are probably more important than things that are given one-liners. Play with those objects.  If a machine is described as having component parts, look at the parts, and try manipulating them.   Likewise, notice the verbs that the game itself uses.  Try using those yourself.  Games often include special verbs -- the names of magic spells, or other special commands.  There's no harm in attempting something if the game mentions it.

Rephrase.  If you have something in mind that you want to do, but can't get the game to respond, try alternative wordings.  Often synonyms are provided.  Game designers usually try to anticipate all the synonyms you are likely to come up with, but they may not have thought of yours.

Try variations.  Sometimes an action doesn't work, but *does* produce some kind of unusual result.  These are often indications that you're on the right track, even if you haven't figured out quite the right approach yet.  Pressing the red button alone may only cause a grinding noise from inside the wall, so perhaps pressing the blue and *then* the red will open the secret door.

Try to understand the game's internal logic.  Sometimes there is a system in play that does not operate in the normal world -- a kind of magic, for instance, or technology we don't have on modern-day earth.  If you've been introduced to such a system in the game, ask yourself how you might apply it to the situations that are still causing you problems.

Check the *whole* screen.  Are there extra windows besides the main window?  What's going on in those?  Check out the status bar, if there is one -- it may contain the name of the room you're in, your score, the time of day, your character's state of health, or some other important information.  If there's something up there, it's worth paying attention to that, too.  When and where does it change?  Why is it significant?  If the bar is describing your character's health, you can bet there is probably a point at which that will be important.

Consider the genre of the game.  Mysteries, romances, and thrillers all have their own types of action and motivation.  What are you trying to do, and how do conventional characters go about doing that?  What's the right sort of behavior for a detective/romance heroine/spy?

Play with someone else.  Two heads are usually better than one.

Try typing HINT, HELP, INFO, ABOUT: one or more of these are often implemented as a source of suggestions about how to get past difficult spots.  If that doesn't work, try emailing the author or (better yet) posting a request for hints on the newsgroup rec.games.int-fiction.  For best results, put the name of the game you want help with in the subject line; then leave a page or so of blank "spoiler space" (so that no one will read about where you got to in the game unless they've already played it), and describe your problem as clearly as possible.  Someone will probably be able to tell you how to get around it.

Email the author: If you're stuck somewhere that just makes no sense at all, it's possible that you're facing a bug.  If you think you are, you should email the author (politely) to report the problem and ask for a way around it.
Good luck!

>go to town. look at building to south
(visiting the Town)

Town
Once a farming settlement, the buildings here are the ruined shells of simple dwellings. Most of the roofs caved in centuries ago, but if you can find one intact it's still your best bet for staying warm overnight. The street continues south towards a square and the main road stretches out of town to the north-east.

Your bike stands chained here.

On the motorbike are a battery and a chain.
It looks like there are more buildings down in the square.

>square. look at building to south-east

Square
Many travellers have passed through here before you. The square is no more than a few dozen paces across surrounded by buildings, but is littered with detritus from campers. The street continues north out of town.

The door to the church stands ajar.

You can also see some bins (in which is rubbish) here.
You can't see any such thing.
